# Session 1: First Steps with Data Preparation

Welcome to the first session of our machine learning workshop for geophysicists! In this session, we will focus on understanding and preparing our data before diving into machine learning algorithms. Our hands-on exercise will involve calibrating a turbidity probe to best predict the suspended load in rivers.

## Objectives

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- Investigate the basic statistical properties of the data
- Assess the quality and quantity of the training data
- Determine if the data is stationary
- Identify relevant features for solving the task at hand
- Understand the concept of overfitting and how to avoid it

## Overview

The success of a machine learning model heavily depends on the quality of the data and how well it has been prepared. In this session, we will cover the following topics:

1. **Data exploration**: Get familiar with the data by visualizing it and calculating summary statistics. This will help you identify trends, patterns, and potential issues in the data.

2. **Training data assessment**: Evaluate the amount and quality of the available training data. Determine if you have enough data points to train a reliable model and identify potential biases in the data.

3. **Stationarity**: Check if the data is stationary, i.e., if its statistical properties, such as mean and variance, are constant over time. Non-stationary data can lead to unreliable model predictions, so we may need to apply transformations or other techniques to make the data stationary.

4. **Feature selection**: Identify the most relevant features for predicting the suspended load in rivers. This may involve domain knowledge, correlation analysis, or other feature selection techniques.

5. **Overfitting**: Understand the concept of overfitting and how it can affect the performance of your machine learning model. Learn techniques to prevent overfitting, such as cross-validation, regularization, or reducing model complexity.

## Hands-on Exercise: Turbidity Probe Calibration

In this exercise, we will apply the concepts learned in this session to a real-world problem: calibrating a turbidity probe to best predict the suspended load in rivers. We will walk through the steps of data exploration, assessment, and preparation to build a foundation for future sessions, where we will apply machine learning algorithms to this problem.

Let's get started!
